# Baeshaza Discord Bot
Baeshaza is a Discord bot created as a passion project for a [Lost Ark](https://www.playlostark.com/en-us) guild. Named after the Lost Ark boss Brelshaza, Baeshaza was designed to enhance the guild's Discord experience. Although not the largest bot I've made, it was certainly the most charming, with around 100 active users at its peak.

Built using the [Sapphire](https://sapphirejs.dev/) Discord.js framework, Baeshaza offers several features to enrich guild interactions:

## Features
- **Custom welcome message**: Greet new members joining the Discord server.
- **Karma/gratitude point system**: Allows members to send private anonymous messages of appreciation to each other, functioning like a candygram system. This feature encourages members to be excellent to each other by accumulating points with each anonymous message received.
- **Moderation commands**: Provides basic moderation tools and audit logging to maintain order within the server.

This is no longer being maintained.
